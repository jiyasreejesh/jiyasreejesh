## Hi, I’m Jiya Sreejesh 👋  
Data Science Undergraduate at UC San Diego

I am a Data Science student with hands-on experience building machine learning models, analyzing real-world datasets, and delivering insights through clean, reproducible code. I enjoy working on applied problems where data analysis and modeling directly inform decisions, products, or user experience.

I am particularly interested in data science internships focused on machine learning, analytics, and data-driven product development.
